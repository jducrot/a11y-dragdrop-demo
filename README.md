# dragdrop-demo
This project displays multiple variations of 2 common UX scenarios for which drag-and-drop(DnD) widgets are often used. The goal of this project is to build these variations to have them tested by various user groups with different disabilities and assistive technology users and share their feedback in a session at the 2025 CSUN AT conference.
